High-Level Testing:
In the very start of our testing we simply ran the server on local host in order to make sure that 
more than one user could recieve the updates and messages. We then began to use different forms of print statements
in order to verify that the Server and Client had proper chat communication. This initial test was done on the MAC - OS.
We then ran these same tests on the Linux Servers and finally with the Windows 10 OS. After checking our main logical parts, 
we tested features such as individual chats, multiple chats, and log off and on. We ended our testing with one final use of the chat program on both computers.
